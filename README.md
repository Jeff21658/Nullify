Nullify is permanently discontinued.

To whom it may concern,

We, the creators of the Nullify iReady exploit, would like to make it clear that we do not support or condone the use of our exploit for cheating or manipulating iReady assessments. Our exploit was developed for educational purposes only, as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities in the iReady system.

We acknowledge that our actions may have unintended consequences and apologize for any harm that may have been caused. It was never our intention to undermine the integrity of educational assessments or to provide an unfair advantage to any individual or group of students.

Therefore, we officially disclaim the use of the Nullify iReady exploit and advise against its use in any capacity. We hope that students and educators alike will choose to pursue academic excellence through honest and hard work, without resorting to any unethical or unfair means to gain an advantage.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

The Nullify Team.
